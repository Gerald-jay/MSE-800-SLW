- ## Summary Diagnosis
    *   **Strengths:** Demonstrates experience in relevant technologies (Java, Python, React, Flask, SQL, Docker, Git). Shows experience in full-stack development and data processing.
    *   **Gaps:** Lacks quantifiable achievements and specific project details. The summary is generic and doesn't highlight unique value. No project section to showcase personal work.
    *   **Clarity:** Generally clear but lacks detail. The experience section could be more descriptive.
    *   **Seniority Signal:** 10+ years of experience suggests mid-level to senior, but the descriptions are too basic to confirm. Needs more impact-driven accomplishments.

- ## ATS Readiness
    *   **Keywords:** Good base keywords, but could be expanded based on target roles (e.g., specific frameworks, cloud platforms).
    *   **Formatting:** Simple and clean, which is good for ATS.
    *   **Length:** Appropriate length.
    *   **Tense/First-Person:** Consistent past tense is needed for past roles. Avoid first-person pronouns.

- ## Section-by-Section Fixes
    *   **Header:** Good. Consider adding a LinkedIn profile URL.
    *   **Summary:** Too generic. Needs to be more specific about accomplishments and career goals. Example: "Results-oriented software developer with 10+ years of experience building scalable web applications and data-intensive services. Proven ability to deliver high-quality solutions using Python, Java, and React. Seeking a challenging role where I can leverage my expertise to drive innovation and improve efficiency."
    *   **Skills:** Categorize skills (e.g., Languages, Frameworks, Databases, Tools). Add proficiency levels (e.g., "Proficient in Java").
    *   **Experience Bullets:** Use STAR/Situation-Task-Action-Result phrasing.
        *   **Original:** "Built internal dashboards in React and Flask"
        *   **Improved:** "Developed and maintained internal dashboards using React and Flask, resulting in a 20% reduction in data retrieval time for internal teams."
        *   **Original:** "Wrote ETL scripts in Python to process CSV data"
        *   **Improved:** "Designed and implemented ETL pipelines in Python using Pandas to process large CSV datasets, improving data processing efficiency by 15%."
        *   **Original:** "Collaborated with designers and PMs to deliver features"
        *   **Improved:** "Collaborated with designers and product managers in an agile environment to deliver key features for the internal dashboard, ensuring alignment with user needs and project goals."
    *   **Education:** Good.
    *   **Projects:** Add a "Projects" section to showcase personal projects or contributions to open-source projects. Include a brief description, technologies used, and a link to the repository (if applicable).
    *   **Certs:** Add a "Certifications" section if applicable.

- ## Skills Gap & Learning Plan
    *   **Missing/Core Skills:** Based on common backend/data-intensive roles, consider adding:
        *   Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
        *   Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
        *   Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
        *   Testing frameworks (JUnit, pytest)
        *   CI/CD pipelines
    *   **30-60-90 Day Upskilling Outline:**
        *   **30 Days:** Focus on learning the basics of a cloud platform (e.g., AWS). Complete an introductory course and deploy a simple application.
        *   **60 Days:** Dive deeper into container orchestration with Kubernetes. Learn how to deploy and manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
        *   **90 Days:** Explore message queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ. Implement a simple message queue system in a personal project.
