Implemented an Auckland Port logistics system using Singleton and Factory patterns. The LogisticsHub is a Singleton entry point that centralizes routing rules and orchestration. A registry-based Factory (TransportFactory) dynamically builds transport objects (RoadTruck, SeaVessel, RailTrain, AirCargo) with different constructor parameters. This decouples object creation from business flow and makes adding new modes (e.g., coastal barge) a one-line registration without changing the hub or client code.
